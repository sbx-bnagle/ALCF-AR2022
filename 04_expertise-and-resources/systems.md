# Networking

InfiniBand enables communication between system I/O nodes and the ALCF’s various storage systems. The Production HPC SAN is built upon NVIDIA Mellanox High Data Rate (HDR) InfiniBand hardware. Two 800-port core switches provide the backbone links between 80 edge switches, yielding 1600 total available host ports, each at 200 Gbps, in a non-blocking fat-tree topology. The full bisection bandwidth of this fabric is 320 Tbps. The HPC SAN is maintained by the NVIDIA Mellanox Unified Fabric Manager (UFM), providing Adaptive Routing to avoid congestion, as well as the NVIDIA Mellanox Self-Healing Interconnect Enhancement for InteLligent Datacenters (SHIELD) resiliency system for link fault detection and recovery.

When external communications are required, Ethernet is the interconnect of choice. Remote user access, systems maintenance and management, and high-performance data transfers are all enabled by the Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) Ethernet infrastructure. This connectivity is built upon a combination of Extreme Networks SLX and MLXe routers and NVIDIA Mellanox Ethernet switches.

ALCF systems connect to other research institutions over multiple 100 Gbps Ethernet circuits that link to many high performance research networks, including local and regional networks like the Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN), as well as national and international networks like the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) and Internet2.
