title: Accessing ALCF Resources for Science
intro: "As a national user facility dedicated to open science, any researcher in the world with a large-scale computing problem can apply for time on ALCF computing resources."

Researchers gain access to ALCF systems for computational science and engineering projects through competitive, peer-reviewed allocation programs supported by the DOE and Argonne.

The ALCF also hosts competitive, peer-reviewed application programs designed to prepare key scientific applications and innovative computational methods for the architecture and scale of DOE supercomputers.

# Allocation Programs


## INCITE
The Innovative Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program aims to accelerate scientific discoveries and technological innovations by awarding ALCF computing time and resources to large-scale, computationally intensive projects that address grand challenges in science and engineering.

## ALCC
The ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge (ALCC) program allocates ALCF computing resources to projects that advance the DOE mission; help to broaden the community of researchers capable of using leadership computing resources; and serve the national interests for scientific discovery, technological innovation, and economic competitiveness.

## Director's Discretionary
Director’s Discretionary projects are dedicated to leadership computing preparation, INCITE and ALCC scaling, and efforts to maximize scientific application efficiency and productivity on leadership computing platforms.

# Application Programs


## ADSP
The ALCF Data Science Program (ADSP) supports big data projects that require the scale and performance of leadership computing resources. ADSP projects focus on developing and improving data science techniques that will enable researchers to gain insights into very large datasets produced by experimental, simulation, or observational methods.

## ESP
As part of the process of bringing a new supercomputer into production, the ALCF conducts its Early Science Program (ESP) to prepare applications for the architecture and scale of a new system. ESP projects represent a typical system workload at the ALCF and cover key scientific areas and numerical methods.
